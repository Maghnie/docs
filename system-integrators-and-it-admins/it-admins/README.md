# aedifion edge device

## Overview

The [aedifion edge device](../../aedifion.io/gateway.md) is an industrial PC which covers functionality such as being an automation network gateway \(therefore it has two ethernet ports\) and providing computing power for those aedifion services, which are sensitive to internet connection losses.

For plug and play installation of the device, aedifion preconfigures its network interfaces before shipping it to you. Therefore please provide the [required shipping information](./#required-shipping-information). 

About firewall security: Only outgoing connections from the device to the aedifion servers are needed. Set the firewall settings to these [minimum requirements](./#firewall-settings) to enable the aedifion services. 

The[ installation guide](./#installation-guide) provides the necessary information on how to wire the aedifion edge device. Basically, first connect the ethernet cables to the right ports, then plug in power.

For any support, please do not hesitate to [contact us](../../contact.md)!
