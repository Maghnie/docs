# Administration

## Overview

In this tutorial, we cover user and project management as well as the associated role-based access control \(RBAC\) system. You will learn how to add, modify, and delete users and projects as well as how to add new roles, manage permissions of a role, and assign roles to users.

Administration-wise, the topmost entity on the aedifion.io platform is the _company._ Companies are created and managed by aedifion. They can neither be created nor modified or deleted by their users. 

A _user_  is assigned to exactly one company which can have an arbitrary number of users. Users can modify their personal details and \(with sufficient permissions\), create new users within their company, and delete their own accounts.
