# Data import

## Overview



### Preliminaries

The examples provided in this article partly build on each other. For the sake of brevity, boiler plate code such as imports or variable definitions is only shown once and left out in subsequent examples.

To execute the examples provided in this tutorial, the following is needed:

* A valid login \(username and password\) to the aedifion.io platform. If you do not have a login yet, please [contact us](../contact.md) regarding a demo login. The login used in the example will not work!
* A project.
* Optionally, a working installation of [Python](https://www.python.org/) or [Curl](https://curl.haxx.se/).
