## Application notes

* **Unit sensitivity:** To this state, our algorithms are unit sensitive. Every [pin ](../../glossary.md#pin)and [attribute ](../../glossary.md#attribute)is specified with an unit. Mind the specifications.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If unit conventions are disregarded, this can lead to errors and even misleading results of algorithms.
{% endhint %}

* **Improving results:** We continuously improve our analyses functions, interpretations and recommendations. Thus, performing exactly the same analysis at a later point in time can lead to different results.

{% tab title="Application" %}
_The **Application** tab offers further information for real application of the analysis._

## Recommended Time Span

### 4 weeks

_The **Recommended Time Span** gives the recommended time span for  which the analysis function is intended. The time span is oriented to the time constant of the phenomenon investigated, e.g. in order to analyse weekly accruing patterns, a time span of 4 weeks is recommended. In shorter periods of time, the analysed phenomenon might not occur, while longer periods might lead to superposition of other effects such as seasonal influences and thus blurring of the analysis results. **Of course, analysis functions can be used over flexible periods of time at your personal discretion.**_

## **Recommended Repetition**

### every 3 months

_The Recommended Repetition provides a recommendation when the analysis should be repeated. The recommendation refers to a continuous operation of the analysed system. In the case of changes to the system, both physical and operational, a repetition of the analysis is generally recommended. **Of course, analysis can be repeated at your personal discretion.**_

## Operating Cycle Analysis

The **Operating Cycle Analysis** investigates and interprets the cycle behavior of components. Besides identifying sub-optimal cycle behavior, the algorithm provides recommendations on how to improve cycle rates, and KPIs for deeper insides.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Quick Start" %}
## **Value**

* Lower operating costs
* Higher energy efficiency
* Longer equipment and component life times
* Smoother system integration

## Recommended for component types

* Energy conversion plants
* Components with high start-up expenses
* Heat pumps
* Combined heat and power
* etc.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Description" %}
The **Operating Cycle Analysis** aims towards a more constant operation of components and thereby towards a reduction of operational costs. Frequent start and stop processes lead to energy losses and higher wear and tear of the component compared to a constant operation. Further, a frequently alternating operation of a component, e.g. a heat pump, has negative effects on adjacent components, which are enforced to alternate as well. At the same time, too low cycle rates are an indication of a possible under-supply.

The analysis function identifies excessive as well as too low cycle rates on the basis of the datapoint _operating message_ of the analysed component. It provides interpretations of the current cycle behavior and recommendations on how to improve it. The recommended measures include adaptions of control parameter, simple structural measures, as well as instructions for diagnosis and adjustment of the cause of sub-optimal cycle behavior. Additionally to the automated generation of interpretations and recommendations, the algorithm offers a set of KPIs. They provide deeper insides in the cycle behavior of the analysed component.

## KPIs

Providing deeper insights to the cycle behavior. KPIs support human reasoning.

### Operating time

Operating times KPIs provide information on the total time of operation of the analysed component during the analysed time span.

| KPI Identifier | Description | Value Range | Unit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  operating time | Total time of operation | 0 to inf | h |
|  operating time.relative | Total time of operation divided by total time span | 0 to 100 | % |

### Start

The Start KPI is the count of starts of the analysed component during the analysed time span.

| KPI Identifier | Description | Value Range | Unit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| starts | Count of starts | 0 to inf | count |

### Closed operating cycle

A _closed operating cycle_ is defined as _period of time between a start_ $$n_i$$_of the component an the next start_ $$n_{i+1}$$. The KPI _closed operating cycles_ represents the number of cycles observed during the analysed time span used to determine the operating cycle KPIs \(_cycle times, duty times, switch-off times_\).

| KPI Identifier | Description | Value Range | Unit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| closed operating cycles | Count of closed operating cycles | 0 to inf | count |

### Cycle times

Cycle time KPIs evaluate the cycle times of the closed cycles observed during the analysed time span. The mean, time-weighted average, minimum, and maximum cycle period are determined. In case there were no closed operating cycles observed during the analysed time span, none of the KPI variables are returned on API call.

| KPI Identifier | Description | Value Range | Unit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| cycle times.median | Median of cycle periods | 0 to inf | h |
| cycle times.average | Time-weighted average of cycle periods | 0 to inf | h |
| cycle times.maximum | Longest cycle period | 0 to inf | h |
| cycle times.minimum | Shortest cycle period | 0 to inf | h |

### Duty times

Duty time KPIs evaluate the duty times of the closed cycles observed during the analysed time span. Duty time is defined as the time of component operation in a closed cycle. The mean, time-weighted average, minimum, and maximum duty period are determined. In case there were no closed operating cycles observed during the analysed time span, none of the KPI variables are returned on API call.

| KPI Identifier | Description | Value Range | Unit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| duty times.median | Median of duty periods | 0 to inf | h |
| duty times.average | Time-weighted average of duty periods | 0 to inf | h |
| duty times.maximum | Longest duty period | 0 to inf | h |
| duty times.minimum | Shortest duty period | 0 to inf | h |

### Switch-off times

Switch-off time KPIs evaluate the shutdown times of the closed cycles observed during the analysed time span. Switch-off time is defined as the time of component shutdown in a closed cycle. The mean, time-weighted average, minimum, and maximum switch-off period are determined. In case there were no closed operating cycles observed during the analysed time span, none of the KPI variables are returned on API call.

| KPI Identifier | Description | Value Range | Unit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| switch-off times.median | Median of switch-off periods | 0 to inf | h |
| switch-off times.average | Time-weighted average of switch-off periods | 0 to inf | h |
| switch-off times.maximum | Longest switch-off period | 0 to inf | h |
| switch-off times.minimum | Shortest switch-off period | 0 to inf | h |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Example" %}
The **Operating Cycle Analysis** was applied to a real test bench, the heat pump of the E.ON Energy Research Center, RWTH Aachen University. Thus, a [heat pump component model ](component-data-models.md#heat-pump)was instanced and the respective datapoint mapped to the pin _operating message_. __Figure 1 shows the time series recorded for an exemplary period of 6 hours on a winter day.

![Figure 1: Plot of operating message time series from 12:00 am till 6:00 pm](../../.gitbook/assets/operating_cycle_analysis.png)

The short shut-down times between periods of duty are conspicuous. This is a hint for unnecessary frequent start and stop processes of the heat pump, leading not only to energy losses but also to high wear and tear of the heat pumps scroll compressor.

In order to apply the **Operating Cycle Analysis** for the instanced and mapped heat pump, we defined an analysis config via the aedifion API. Executing the **Operating Cycle Analysis** for the same period of time as figure 1 returns following results:

**Qualitative warning level:** red \(as in traffic light signal color\)

**Interpretation:** Highly increased number of start procedures/operation cycles. A reduction of the starting procedures or a more continuous operation is recommended.

**Recommendations:**

* Check whether the system flow temperature runs into the safety limiter and causes safety shutdowns.
* Check whether the heat requirement is covered too quickly by the producer. If yes, check the modulation operation of the system and, if available, the integration of the buffer tank and the interconnected operation of several generation systems.
* Check the installation of a power choke. By reducing the electrical power consumed, the amount of heat provided can be reduced and thus the effects of an oversized plant. Pay attention to the manufacturer's specifications as to whether the installation of a choke is technically possible.

**KPIs:**

| KPI | Value | Unit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| operating time | 4.31 | h |
| operating time.relative | 71.8 | % |
| starts | 16 | count |
| closed operating cycles | 15 | count |
| cycle times.median | 0.36 | h |
| cycle times.average | 0.369 | h |
| cycle times.maximum | 0.41 | h |
| cycle times.minimum | 0.34 | h |
| duty times.median | 0.254 | h |
| duty times.average | 0.264 | h |
| duty times.maximum | 0.304 | h |
| duty times.minimum | 0.234 | h |
| switch-off times.median | 0.105 | h |
| switch-off times.average | 0.106 | h |
| switch-off times.maximum | 0.106 | h |
| switch-off times.minimum | 0.105 | h |

The automated interpretation confirms our visual analysis of the time series shown in figure 1, summed up by the qualitative warning level "red". The recommendations provide further instruction on how to isolate and fix the cause for the increased number of start and stop processes.

Further, the result offers an advanced set of KPIs, providing additional insights into the cycle behavior of the heat pump. They support human reasoning for case-by-case analysis. For example, the similarity of switch-off times per cycle are peculiar. Since a coincidence would be surprising for such a dynamically operated plant, one could reason, that the heat pump is permanently requested by the higher level controller, but runs into a condition causing a component shutdown for a predefined period of time. Deeper human investigation of the condition is possible via data visualization of aedifion.io and the combination to insights of other analysis functions.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Description" %}
The Temperature Spread Analysis assesses the difference between two temperature pins while an operating message is active.

A thermal control loop is a typical case where outlet and return temperature are different and a temperature spread that is higher indicates a good utilization of this loop. A lower temperature spread suggests a reduced energy demand of the connected consumers and thus should lead to a reduction of volume flow caused by a reduced pump speed that saves electricity.
