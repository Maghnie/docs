# AI meta data generation

## Problem Description

Since there a usually hundreds or thousands of datapoints within a building it is often very difficult to find structure in the heap of data. Additional meta data read from e.g. BACnet devices may help to add form, but might also be wrongly annotated. Therefore, we provide you with an AI system, that will analyze the obtained data from your buildings and provide annotations on what the datapoints represent. Each week this service provides you with an updated estimate on your building's datapoints.

## Supervised Learning

The method we apply for creating such an AI system is _supervised learning_. This methods creates a model based upon training data examples and their known annotations \(called training set\). The model is basically a parameterized function from the input data to a probability distribution over the target labels. Each model uses the training set as input, then optimizes its parameters to match the known annotations best.
