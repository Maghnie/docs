## Introduction to aedifion.io

## Technical overview

aedifion.io offers plant-, building- and district-wide [data acquisition](https://docs.aedifion.io/docs/aedifion.io/features#advanced-data-ingress) based on IP technology.

Once acquired, it stores data in time series databases guaranteeing for highest performance within data retrieval and processing. 

It offers computational power to process data and has a flexible data provision concept. Comprehensive APIs make it easy to integrate many different applications, such as e.g. MS Excel, Matlab, Amazon's Alexa, or your favourite data processing tool or programming language. It offers the possibility to integrate many different thrid party data sources, such as e.g. weather forecasts, MS Exchange. 

aedifion.io provides different data visualization dashboards which can be individually customized. 

It generates notifications and alarms based on concepts, such as e.g. "threshold" and "throughput", whith various channels, such as E-Mail, Telegram, Slack, or even MQTT.

As aedifion.io originates from research, it has profound data structuring concepts to cope for meta data management, multiple [datapointkeys](https://docs.aedifion.io/docs/glossary#datapointkey), and semantic modelling of energy system structures. 

aedifion.io enables remote control for each connected system. Control algorithms can also be integrated into the aedifion.io cloud platform or into its edge devices with customized APIs.
