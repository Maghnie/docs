## 30,000 ft overview 

![Overview of the aedifion.io IoT platform](../.gitbook/assets/aedifion.io-overview%20%281%29.png)

aedifion.io is an IoT platform that provides various [features](features.md), such as data filing and processing, AI and domain specific analytics and controls, semantic data, user management and many more.

aedifion.io's leading use case is to connect to a local plant, file all available data, use the analytics to gain insights and use controls to optimize the local plants' operation.

 In the following we introduce its main ingredients. 

The aedifion [edge device](gateway.md) provides plug-and-play web connectivity to building automation systems and to automation systems of energy-related plants, such as e.g. combined heat and power plants, air handling units, air handling units etc.

The aedifion [frontend ](frontend.md)is a browser-based human machine interface \(HMI\). It offers data visualization, management, platform administration and provides access to various features.

aedifion.io's [application programming interfaces ](apis.md)\(APIs\) offer access to all mayor platform features and functionalities. Programmers can use them directly. 

Based on these APIs, aedifion offers applications like its floorplan app and its 3D HMI and services like control algorithm development, and AI development and consulting. 

aedifion's trusted partners offer building, multi-building and district-wide energy management as well as building performance optimization as-a-service.

aedifion.io integrates 3rd party data, such as e.g. weather predictions and Microsoft Exchange serves, connects to 3rd party platforms, such as CumulocityIoT, and is integrated into 3rd party applications, such as Microsoft Excel. Further, it offers full integrations of 3rd party apps like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). 

## Further products

[aedifion.analytics](../aedifion.analytics.md) features deep analytics for technical equipment within your plant. It focuses on the calculation of key performance indicators for components within local plants and the derivation of recommendations for action. See [aedifion.analytics](../aedifion.analytics.md) for detailed information.

[aedifion.controls](../aedifion.controls.md) provides a framework of basic control functionalities that are a prerequisite for modern controls as well as predefined control algorithms, such as optimizer for air handling unit operations or MS Exchange augmented room controls. See [aedifion.controls](../aedifion.controls.md) for detailed information

aedifion.custom adepts .io, .analytics, and .controls to your needs with e.g. picked modules and functionalities as well as tailored APIs. [Contact us](../contact.md) to discuss your requirements.
