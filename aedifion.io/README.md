## Introduction

aedifion.io offers plant-, building- and district-wide [data acquisition](https://docs.aedifion.io/docs/aedifion.io/features#advanced-data-ingress) based on IP technology.

{% hint style="success" %}
aedifion.io works fully plug-and-play for BACnet system. All it needs is a gateway that operating personnell can easily connect to local networks.
