# Features

## Advanced Data Ingress

aedifion.io offers plant-, building- and district-wide data acquisition compatible to many bus communication standards. Moreover, it integrates all IP-available data sources, replicates local data bases and connects to existing data servers. In addition, users or devices can stream their data directly into aedifion.io.

| Type | Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| Bus communication | BACnet, Modbus, KNX, M-Bus,... |
| Data servers | OPC DA, OPC UA |
| Local data bases | MS SQL, mySQL, pgSQL, ... |
| Rest APIs | MS Exchange, weather data, weather forecasts,... |

{% hint style="info" %}
We aspire to integrate &lt;&lt;everything that is IP-based available&gt;&gt;.

## Have you had a chance to answer the previous question?

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.
